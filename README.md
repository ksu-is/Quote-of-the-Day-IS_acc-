# Quote-of-the-Day
A calculator application that returns a relevant quote when its corresponding button is pushed.


This project will feature a calculator-like application with no math functions. Instead, when a user clicks a button (Sunday-Saturday), a quote relating to that day will pop up. Lists labeled 'sunday_quotes'through 'saturday_quotes' will be called on when its corresponding button is pressed. A while loop will cause the next line in the string to appear until there are no more lines. At the point of no more lines, the seek will return to 0.
The calculator will be larger than the average calculator given its long output.

This code is inspired by the Youtibe video 'Python Tkinter 06 Link Buttons to Function; by George Boole.
