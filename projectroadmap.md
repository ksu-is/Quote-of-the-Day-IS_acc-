#Project code example

NOTE: Final code is in 'quote_of_the_day_' file.
Other code is practice.

This project was inspired by Professor Thomas' calcGUI code located on his Github account page at https://github.com/dominict/pythonteachingcode. 
The code features uses tkinter to display a calculator on a user's desktop. Features such as math imports, a class, and definitions are used. 

The code runs well and I expect to use the overall structure for my project, while adding my unique code along the way. Given the purposes for this project, I will use the Application frame code to display a 'calculator' on screen and use unique functions rather than importing math.

Implemented code from a Youtube video called "Python Tkinter 06 Links Buttons to Functions' by George Boole rather than the 'Python Teaching Code' code. The new code is more in line with my project needs as my calculator is for text and not math functions. With this new code, the GUI was not popping up. A classmate suggested I add 'rw.mainloop()' to the end of my coed and this solved the problem.

Emerging task: add monday_fun through sat_func

Status of above emerging task: DONE

Although all buttons are on the GUI, in their correct positions, and are displaying the commanded code when pressed, there are a few changes that need to be made. Rather than displaying all 3 strings in a list, I would like to get the function to print each statement one at a time for each time the button is pressed. 

Emerging task: iterate one string at a time

Emerging task: establish a count or seek that re positions the pointer to the first string once all 3 strings have been displayed

Update: tried saving a sunday.txt file that contained a list of 3 strings. Pushed this file to github, and used the url to attempt to open and read lines from this file. A syntax error popped up in the terminal.
